# Amex Campus Challenge 2024: Predictive Modeling for Data Analysis

## Project Overview
The **Amex Campus Challenge 2024** involved building a high-performing predictive model using a **1 lakh data point** dataset derived from **3 different sources**. The primary goal was to develop a model that could accurately predict outcomes, leveraging a range of advanced techniques, including **feature engineering**, **data optimization**, and **machine learning**. My solution aimed to push the boundaries of what could be achieved through thoughtful application of state-of-the-art machine learning methods.

## Key Accomplishments
### 1. Feature Engineering:
- Extracted and engineered **185 custom features**, enhancing the dataset's utility for predictive modeling.
- Employed **KL Divergence** to analyze the relationships and dependencies between features, identifying crucial patterns within the data.

### 2. Data Optimization:
- Applied **log transformations** to key features to ensure a more normalized distribution, leading to better model training and performance.
- Optimized dataset preparation techniques for improved memory usage and faster computation.

### 3. Advanced Representation:
- Implemented **neural network embeddings** to capture complex patterns in the dataset, enabling more accurate model predictions.

### 4. Ensemble Learning:
- Utilized an **ensemble blending classifier** to combine multiple machine learning models, resulting in improved performance with an accuracy of **58.75%**.

## Potential Improvements
### XGBoost with Learning Rate Decay:
- The model's performance could have been enhanced by training **XGBoost** with an **exponential decay learning rate**, which would have suited the dataset's characteristics and potentially led to even more exceptional results.

## Results
- Achieved **58.75% accuracy** using the ensemble classifier technique.
- Advanced to **Round 2** of the competition, demonstrating the effectiveness of the applied techniques.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and feature extraction.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing machine learning models and ensemble techniques.
- **Keras/TensorFlow**: For implementing neural network embeddings.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and analysis.
